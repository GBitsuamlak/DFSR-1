# A divergence-free inflow turbulence generator using spectral representation method for large-eddy simulation of ABL flows

A computationally efficient procedure is implemented with interpolation enhanced decomposition of the cross-power spectral density matrix followed by the generation of the velocity field using the fast Fourier transformation technique.
